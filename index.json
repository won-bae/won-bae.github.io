We improved the performance of small object detection through super-resolving the features of small objects to be similar to those of large objects. We investigated direct supervision using target features helps super-resolution only if they are properly extracted in terms of relative receptive field. We proposed a super-resolution model that can properly extract target features so that the features of small objects can be efficiently super-resolved, and as a result, they help better detect small objects. Our proposed method significantly improved the performance on various object detection datasets, especially for small objects, regardless of backbone strucutres.
